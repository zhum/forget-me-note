## Notes about android prototype

# This is design only

No code, no functionality. You can easily modify it, 
sometimes there can be strange units used (I'm not perfect
in android design and programming...), feel free to make it **right way**.

# Missing and extra things

I got many errors about android icons, it is needed to turn on something to fix it.

I tried to create Settings activity by addin 'SettingsActivity', but got only code.
Then I created PreferencesActivity with layout. Feel free to delete SettingsActivity,
if it is needed.
